## Genre
Multiplayer open-world survival sandbox with a pirate theme and mystical progression.

## Platform
PC (Steam)

## Visual Style
Low-poly style with stylized art, semi-realistic animated water, and dynamic atmospheric effects.

## Game Summary
The player wakes up shipwrecked on an unknown archipelago with nothing but their wits to survive. They can build shelters, explore islands and seas, face fantastic creatures, and cooperate or compete with other players. The game evolves from basic survival to epic naval battles with supernatural elements.

The main narrative includes references to real and literary pirates. There is no mandatory final objective, but the story provides direction for updates, encourages exploration, and adds context. The origin of the shipwreck and the motivation to return to sea will be defined later on.

## Core Mechanics

### Survival
- Hydration, hunger, sleep, and temperature systems.

### Building
- Modular crafting.
- Naval and land construction.
- Shared structures between crewmates or allies via permissions and pin codes.

### Navigation
- Manual control of vessels.
- Environmental threats (storms, rocks, etc.).
- Naval combat.
- Water interaction.

### Progression & Classes
- Specialization branches with no rigid classes (e.g., cannoneer, blacksmith, navigator).
- Eventually, players can unlock all branches.
- Interaction with NPCs who can take roles on the ship, such as steering.

### Trade & Economy
- Internal economy system with player-to-player trading.
- Adds balance and extends gameplay longevity.

### Exploration & Mysteries
- Treasure maps.
- Hidden temples.
- Supernatural events.

### Taming & Breeding *(advanced stage)*
- Land and sea animals with practical or mystical utility.

### Scaled PvP & PvE
- Instanced zones: safe, no structure destruction, but may include NPC invasions depending on group progress.
- Islands in calm seas: temporary camps, environmental hostility, short-lived structures, recoverable loot.
- Lawless seas: PvP enabled, higher hostility and rewards, limited construction for combat and defense.

### Death & Respawn
- All inventory and equipment are lost on death.
- Your body is marked on the map.
- Respawn occurs on the same island where you died.

## Current Status
- Land movement implemented (with physics and free rotation).
- Water interaction in development.
- Animated water shader with distortion nearly complete.

## Immediate Goals
- Implement a basic floating boat.
- Allow getting on and off the boat.
- Establish the base for the interactive naval system.

## Development Phases
1. Basic movement and navigation.
2. Water interaction and simple boats.
3. Basic exploration and modular building.
4. PvE with creatures, weather, and hostile structures.
5. Zone-based PvP, trading, and character progression.
6. Expansion into mystical elements.
7. Integration of collaborative NPCs on ships.
8. Dedicated servers or MMO option.

## Monetization
Not considered in the initial stage. Future monetization may include cosmetics only.

## Target Audience
PC players who enjoy exploration, survival, and games like **Valheim**, **Raft**, **Sea of Thieves**, or **ARK**.

## Scalability
The design allows starting with a small prototype and scaling into a persistent MMO if resources permit.

## World Scope
The world will be vast, fully navigable, with multiple islands encouraging meaningful exploration.

## Legal Considerations (to research)
- Assess use of historical pirate names (e.g., Blackbeard).
- Assess copyright on literary figures (e.g., Long John Silver, Treasure Island).
