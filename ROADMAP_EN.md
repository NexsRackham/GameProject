# PROJECT ROADMAP – *(PENDING NAME)*

## Approach
Development will be organized in phases of increasing complexity, starting with a functional prototype in basic cooperative mode, scaling toward more complex content and advanced multiplayer features.

---

## Phase 0 – Base Prototype

**Goal:** Validate core mechanics for movement, navigation, and physics in a controlled environment.

- [x] Player movement with physics.
- [x] Free-rotation camera system.
- [x] Animated water shader.
- [x] Basic interaction with water.
- [x] Swimming system with buoyancy and diving.
- [ ] Basic boat buoyancy. *(in progress)*
- [ ] Getting on and off the boat both on land and in water.
- [ ] Basic boat controls.
- [ ] Island and shoreline detection system.
- [ ] Basic non-functional interface with health and needs indicators.
- [ ] First explorable area.
- [ ] Simple navigable terrain.
- [ ] Landing and anchoring on islands.
- [ ] Local save/load system.

---

## Phase 1 – Basic Playable World

**Goal:** Integrate basic building and functional navigation, laying the foundation for extended gameplay.

- [ ] Basic inventory.
- [ ] Health, hunger, thirst, and temperature systems.
- [ ] Basic resource gathering and early crafting items.
- [ ] Simple land-based construction system.
- [ ] Inventory and crafting management.
- [ ] First basic combat system (melee weapon).
- [ ] Land with collectible resources.
- [ ] First basic land creature.
- [ ] Basic environmental threats (e.g., boat interacting with rocks).

---

## Phase 2 – Advanced Gameplay

**Goal:** Enable more complex exploration and player specialization. At this stage, we should be considering reestructuring with assets.

- [ ] Basic navigation interface.
- [ ] Ship control from the helm (sails, direction).
- [ ] Expanded navigation system: wind direction, speed, sail physics.
- [ ] Leveling and base skill tree systems.
- [ ] Chests and doors with PINs/permissions.
- [ ] Temporary camps and degrading structures.
- [ ] Interaction with hostile NPCs.
- [ ] Respawn and corpse recovery system.
- [ ] Advanced combat system (ranged).
- [ ] Advanced modular land construction system.
- [ ] Naval construction with modules.
- [ ] Complex crafting and gear upgrades.
- [ ] Advanced environmental threats (storms, whirlpools).
- [ ] Navigation assistant NPCs.
- [ ] AI invasion events.
- [ ] Division into PvE, safe, and dangerous zones.

---

## Phase 3 – Functional Multiplayer

**Goal:** Enable player network connectivity, session management, and persistent bases.

- [ ] Player-to-player hosting.
- [ ] First functional guild or crew.
- [ ] Synchronization of structures, objects, and ships.
- [ ] Creation of allied crews.
- [ ] Trading system between players.
- [ ] Structure sharing via permissions.
- [ ] Remote saving of persistent worlds.

---

## Phase 4 – Extra Content

**Goal:** Add depth to endgame content and extend gameplay longevity.

- [ ] Story/lore featuring historical/literary pirates.
- [ ] Ghost ships, cursed treasures, magical fog.
- [ ] Procedurally generated dungeons.
- [ ] Element application (fire, ice, darkness).
- [ ] Magical compasses.
- [ ] Narrative interaction with global events.
- [ ] Internal economy system (market).
- [ ] First quest triggered by specific events.

---

## Phase 5 – MMO Scaling

**Goal:** Turn the experience into a persistent, connected world.

- [ ] Implementation of dedicated servers or hosted infrastructure.
- [ ] World scaling with multiple biomes, sea routes, and factions.
- [ ] Advanced AI for NPCs (privateers, fleets, etc).
- [ ] Aesthetic customization (cosmetics).
- [ ] Monetization evaluation through in-game store.

## Notes
- Phases may partially overlap.
- This roadmap is a living document and will adapt based on feedback, resources, and technical testing.
